I am a security researcher at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/trustworthy-systems-asia/#!overview">Trustworthy Systems</a> group in the Systems and Networking research area in Microsoft Research Asia. I received my Ph.D. in Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
My research  interests include IoT security, cyber security and network measurements, with the specific focus on using a data-driven approach to study threats, weakness and abuse on network/IoT devices at global scale.
